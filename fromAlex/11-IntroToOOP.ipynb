    "<h2>11.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is presented here in opposition to procedural programming. <b>Procedural</b> programs consider two entities: data and functions. Procedurally, the two things are different: a function will take data as input and return data as output (this should sound familiar!). There's nothing customizable about a function with respect to data, which means you can use functions on various types of data with no restrictions... which can you get into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, though, we tend to think of things as having both \"state\" and \"behavior\". People can have a state (tall, short, etc.) but also a behavior (playing basketball, running, etc.), and the two can happen simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming attempts to imitate this approach, so specific objects in the code will have a state and a behavior attached to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>11.2 What is an Object?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "An object in programming has two entities attached to it: data... and the things that <i>act</i> on that data. The data are called <b>attributes</b>, and the functions attached to the object that can act on that data are called <b>methods</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are specifically made to act on attributes; they aren't just random functions meant as one-size-fits-all solutions, which is what we would see in procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are generally specific realizations of some <b>class</b> or <b>type</b>. As an example, individual people are specific realizations of the <b>class</b> of human beings. Specific realizations (instances) differ from each other in details but have the same overall pattern. In OOP, specific realizations are <b>instances</b> and common patterns are <b>classes</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>11.3 How do Objects Work?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, strings (like almost everything in Python) are objects. Built into Python, there is a class called 'strings', and each time you make a new string, you're using that definition. Python implicitly defines attributes and methods for all string objects; no matter what string you create, you have that set of data and functions associated with your string."
