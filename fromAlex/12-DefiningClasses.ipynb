    "<h2>12.0 Last Time...</h2>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Objects</b> have attributes and methods associated with them that can be listed using <b>dir()</b>.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Methods for strings include <b>upper()</b>, <b>isupper()</b>, <b>count()</b>, <b>title()</b>, etc.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Methods for arrays include <b>reshape()</b>, <b>ravel()</b>, <b>round()</b>, etc.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>12.1 Defining A Class: The Theory</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about how all objects are instances of a class. Using <b>dir()</b> in the previous lecture, we saw the list of attributes and methods for the <b>string</b> and <b>array</b> classes. But just as you sometimes want to create your own functions depending on your application, sometimes you want to create your own classes!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to get a little abstract, so bear with me while we go through this in text form - we'll soon be looking and writing plenty of our own examples! This is complex and a little hard to think about because we're actually messing with the way Python works at a more fundamental level rather than just applying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the <b>def</b> statement for functions, creating a new class involves a <b>class</b> statement. The indented block after this class statement constitutes the definition of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside your definition, to make life easier, you just refer to the instance of the class as <b>self</b>. For example, if you want an attribute called <b>data</b>, within the class definition it will be called <b>self.data</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are defined the same way we've been talking about functions: with a <b>def</b> statement. Each method will have a set of arguments, just the way functions normally do. The first argument in a method when defining a new class is generally going to just be the word <b>self</b>, which essentially means \"take everything we have thus far and make use of it in what follows\". This is an argument you won't have to type in when you're actually <i>using</i> the method; it's just for behind-the-scenes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, your first method will be called <b>\\_\\_init\\_\\_</b> (remember, the double-underscores indicate a fundamental method in a given class!). Every time you create an instance of your new class (for example, every time you create a string as an instance of the string class), this \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method will be called. \"Init\" stands for \"initialization\"; this is where you put any important information you'll need when creating a new instance of a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, this has been a lot. Let's see it in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>12.2 Defining A Class: The Code</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a class that's called simply <b>Book</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a bunch of information associated with a book (its author, publisher, title, etc.), we can store it as an instance of the class Book. Rather than having it be a string or a list or a dictionary, it will just be called a Book. We can then come up with some helpful methods that will define what we can do to Books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start our class definition. We use the word <b>class</b>, followed by the name of our class (by convention, they're typically capitalized). We then put the word <b>object</b> in parentheses; this argument is a special object that just identifies this as a class that doesn't depend on other classes. For the purposes of this course, just remember: a class definition should have the argument <b>object</b>."
