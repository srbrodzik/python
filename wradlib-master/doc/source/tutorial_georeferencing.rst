Preface should cover overwiev of:

* need of georeferencing
* gdal as the main dependency for gis in wradlib
* georeferencing of polar radar data
* possibly gridding
* georeferencing of gridded radar data
* projections, spatial reference systems, coordinate transforms
* handling raster data
* handling vector data
* visualizing georeferenced data
