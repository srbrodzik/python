I need to convert some grib2 data files to netcdf.  I found this python
package called pygrib which is supposed to make that easy but found that
before installing pygrib, I need to make something called eccodes.

Do we have this built somewhere on our system?

Or do you know of a better way to do this conversion?

ANSWER FROM DAVE OVENS:

I have eccodes installed on sage in

/home/disk/sage1/mm5rt/GRIB

and other software called wgrib2 which does the conversion this easily:

~ovens/bin/wgrib2 gribfile -netcdf gribfile.nc
