  Description: This is the driver code for the updated version of Steiner et al. (1995)
  convective/stratiform classification code for use with Cartesian gridded datasets. Adds new
  categories for echoes of uncertain rain-type near convective cores and correctly identifies
  isolated, often shallow, convection as convective instead of stratiform. For details, see
  Powell, S.W., R.A. Houze, JR., and S.R. Brodzik, 2016: Rainfall-type categorization of radar
  echoes using polar coordinate reflectivity data, J. Atmos. Oceanic Technol., 17, 523-538 
  (http://www.atmos.washington.edu/MG/PDFs/JTECH16_Powell-etal_RainCat.pdf).

  The variables listed in the left column immediately below are those in the user-input
  parameters farther below. The variables listed in the right column below are the
  corresponding variable names in Table 1 of Powell et al. (2016).

  Inputs:
  refl = Reflectivity
  refl_missing_val = missing value in reflectivity data
  refl_dx (km) = horizontal spacing of grid
  minZdiff = factor for comparing echo to background reflectivity; see equation (1) in journal 
     article referenced above
  deepcoszero = see equation (1) in journal article referenced above
  shallowconvmin = minimum dBZ for classification as convective for objects with area less than 
     startslope
  truncZconvthres = reflectivity threshold at or above which echos are classified as convective;  
     The value in Powell et al. (2016) was used for an S-band radar with a beam width of 0.91 degrees. 
     For C-band and/or larger beam width, this value will probably need to be decreased.  Rain
     type classification is most sensitive to this input.
  dBZformaxconvradius = minimum dBZ required for max_conv_radius to apply; should be somewhere close 
     to truncZconvthres
  weakechothres = minimum dBZ for classification as not weak echo; don't change this without a good 
     reason.  7 is about as low as we can go without getting into Bragg scatter territory.
  backgrndradius (km) = radius within which background reflectivity is computed
  maxConvRadius (km) = maximum radius around convective core for possible uncertain classification; 
     Powell et al. (2016) tested 5, and showed that too much convection was included 
     in stratiform region.  Don't lower this number without a good reason.
  minsize (km^2) = minimum areal coverage a contiguous echo can cover and still receive an ISO_CONV
     classification (See dBZcluster for use)
  startslope (km^2) = any contiguous echo object with areal coverage greater than this but less than 
     maxsize gets a new convective threshold that is linearly interpolated between shallowconvmin and 
     truncZconvthres depending on where between startslope and maxsize its area is (See makedBZcluster)
  maxsize (km^2) = any contiguous echo object greater than this size gets a convective threshold of 
     truncZconvthres (See makedBZcluster)

  rain_type = rain type classification
