Features for the rainfall mapping project

- Know where radar is (lat/lon) and display
- QC data before sending to RadX
- make QC'ed radar images on the fly for each radar scan
- HID using Dolan algorithm 
- Do our own Kdp calculation
- Accumulated rainfall over the last 30 min/60 min
- Age of rainfall at a given point (time since it rained over some threshold)
- Interactive display (GUI)
	- cursors, panning, zooming
- Tracking
	- nowcasting, other features



####### File workflow #######
- Raw UF files will come in from somewhere
- Need to run QC (qc_radar.py) on the new radar file, which gets stored in realtime_cfradial
- Then run RadXConvert to grid the QC'ed data, spit those files out in realtime_gridded
- Then run the python script that will do the HID, rain fall calculations
	- This will require a sounding, will have to think about how to do that. Maybe have a standard one as a default
- Maybe then have a cell tracking/GUI on those fully processed files
