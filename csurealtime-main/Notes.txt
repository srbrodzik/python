Steps for processing and producing realtime rainfall map

1. Get the data, via network or some other means
2. Grid the data, using either RadxConvert or PyART
3. Clutter filter? Should be something in CSU Radartools
4. Apply convective/stratiform algorithm with the one provided by Brenda
5. Rainfall calculations, should be using tropical algorithm provided by Brenda
6. Map and plot it!
7. Apply tracking algorithm?? I will have to work on that.
