    "\n",
    "This starter kit covers a basic LROSE workflow:\n",
    "1. Print data header from a NEXRAD file using RadxPrint.\n",
    "2. Convert Level II data to CfRadial format using RadxConvert.\n",
    "3. Display the data with CfRadial files using Hawkeye.\n",
    "4. Perform coordinate transformations from the polar grid to a regular grid using Radx2Grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes for users:\n",
    "- RadxConvert also supports the conversion from Level II data to sweep format which can still be utilized by soloii users. \n",
    "- RadxConvert will name and sort the files chronologically, so we encourage users to not move the data from the original directory or rename the files.\n",
    "- Users are encouraged to compile their CfRadial files as an aggregation of sweep files that make up a single volume scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following tutorial highlights how to perform the commands, but does not cover all the options. Please see the evolving [documentation](https://nsf-lrose.github.io/docs.html) on the LROSE website for more details"
