[![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/occ-data/goes16-jupyter)

This repo contains a notebook and sample mesoscale data (bands 1-3) from GOES-16. The notebook gives an example of how to read the netcdf files, convert from radiance to reflectance, and generate a psuedo-true color image.

This notebook is designed to work with the docker container available at https://github.com/occ-data/docker-jupyter
