### Sounding Analog Retrieval System (SARS) Database

This folder contains the raw sounding data used in generating the SARS function in SHARPpy.  The data within these folders are proximity soundings (both observed and NWP based) that represent the atmospheric environment nearby certain severe weather phenomena.  This data was generously donated by Rich Thompson and Ryan Jewell.
