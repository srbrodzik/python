Here are the programs I am using to dealias the radial velocity data. (Cleaned
up from my test program.)  It will give you a start.  Today I had trouble
getting the code to find the RSL libraries.  (Frustrating since it worked 6
months ago.0  This is what worked for me:

conda install -c jjhelmus trmm_rsl=1.49   # NOT the conda-forge version
conda install -c conda-forge arm_pyart=1.7.0
* You can check if pyart is finding rsl with
python -c "import pyart; pyart._debug_info()"
