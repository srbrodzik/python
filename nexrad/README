Question about NIDS data from NOAAPORT

Since no one answered you, I suppose I will, even though it's been awhile :)
 
PyArt reads NOAAPort data just fine... I'm migrating from gempak, so I 
store my files in a "gempak" way, but an easy way in python to fetch the 
latest file is to glob it.. such as
 
import sys
import glob
import os
import pyart
 
# Use GLOB to determine the newest file in the directory by creation time
filename = min(glob.iglob('/home/disk/ldm/data/gempak/nexrad/NIDS/IWX/DHR/DHR_*'
), key=os.path.getctime)
print (filename)
radar = pyart.io.read_nexrad_level3(filename)
display = pyart.graph.RadarDisplay(radar)
 
 
Then just use your normal routines to display, or us (agg) if you want to 
save the file as a png.
 
plt.show()
plt.savefig('/home/ldm/util/python/nexrad/'+(pngName), bbox_inches='tight', 
pad_inches=0.25)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SRB NOTE
  I tried this for this dir
  /home/disk/data/gempak/nexrad/NIDS/IWX/NTP
  and it found the oldest file, not the newest file.  Not sure why . . .
